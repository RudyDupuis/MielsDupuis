My first A to Z project: A honey sales site.

It's a Front project.

Page made in HTML and CSS only.
Using Sass for CSS.
Project, not finished. Later, i should make JavaScript.

The animations were made as individual file in the component folder.
All pixel measurements are replaced by a variable and a resize() function. 
When the animation is imported on a page, i declare the variable in px to choose the size of the animation then i import the file containing it.
